NAME
    Apache::AuthenNISPlus - Authenticate into a NIS+ domain

SYNOPSIS
     #httpd.conf
     <Location>
       AuthName "your nis+ account"
       AuthType Basic
       PerlSetVar NISPlus_Passwd_Table passwd.org_dir.yoyodyne.com
       PerlSetVar NISPlus_Group_Table group.org_dir.yoyodyne.com
       PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthenNISPlus
       require group eng
       require user john larry
     </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    Authenticate into a nis+ domain.

    This is pretty lame in that it simply executes
    "/usr/bin/nismatch" with the appropriate arguments. If exposed
    to an unruly user base, that part should be rewritten to gather
    output from an underprivileged child instead of letting the
    shell get involved. An even better answer would probably be to
    hook into Net::NISPlus, but I could not figure out how to do
    that in the few hours I had available.
